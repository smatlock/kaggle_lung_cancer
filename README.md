# Lung Cancer Image Classification

## About the Project

This project aims to classify lung cancer images using machine learning and deep learning techniques, specifically pre-trained Convolutional Neural Nets (CNNs). The dataset consists of CT scan images that are labeled into four distinct classes. The goal is to determine which of the pre-trained CNNs can best classify this data set. The target audience is researchers, students, and machine learning/deep learning enthusiasts.

## Dataset

### Lung Cancer Image Dataset: A Comprehensive Collection

Explore the intricacies of lung cancer with our curated dataset, consisting of high-resolution CT scan images. 

### Key Features

#### CT Scan Images:
Our dataset comprises CT scan images, providing detailed insights into lung cancer morphology. Each image is a visual representation of the complex nature of lung tumors.

#### Split for Comprehensive Analysis:
- **Training Set (613 Images)**: A training set containing 613 images labeled into four distinct classes.
- **Testing Set (315 Images)**: Evaluate the model's performance on 315 images, each belonging to one of the four lung cancer classes.
- **Validation Set (72 Images)**: A curated validation set of 72 images

### Classes:
- **Class 1**: Adenocarcinoma
- **Class 2**: Large Cell Carcinoma
- **Class 3**: Normal
- **Class 4**: Squamous Cell Carcinoma

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.

2. Download the dataset from Kaggle:
   [Lung Cancer Image Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kabil007/lungcancer4types-imagedataset)

3. Extract the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory as expected by the notebook.

4. Install the required packages by running the following command:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


### Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Lung_Cancer_Image_Classification.ipynb
```
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, and run the classification models. Note that building the models will take some time! Be patient, please! :)
